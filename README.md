# Bank-auntheticating-model
Created model using Tensorflow and Neural networks. Used Bank authentication data set. The data consists of 5 columns:  variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), entropy of image (continuous) and class (integer). Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.
